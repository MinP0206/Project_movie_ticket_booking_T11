jobs:
  # Below is the definition of your job to build and test your app, you can rename and customize it as you want.
  build-and-push:
    environment:
      DOCKER_IMAGE: myapp
      DOCKER_TAG: latest
    executor: docker/docker
    steps:
      -
      - setup_remote_docker
      - checkout
      - docker/check:

workflows:
  # Below is the definition of your workflow.
  # Inside the workflow, you provide the jobs you want to run, e.g this workflow runs the build-and-test job above.
  # CircleCI will run this workflow on every commit.
  # For more details on extending your workflow, see the configuration docs: https://circleci.com/docs/configuration-reference/#workflows
  sample:
    jobs:
      - build-and-push
      # For running simple node tests, you could optionally use the node/test job from the orb to replicate and replace the job above in fewer lines.
      # - node/test
